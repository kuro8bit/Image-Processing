# Image Processing

[English](README.en.md) | [日本語](README.md)

---------------------------------------

Codes made for image processing. All codes were made without using openCV ready made functions.

Libraries and programming language used:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)

To install OpenCV via python: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org)
 has support for them, but you should install it on your machine. An option that does not require any installation is the [Colab Google](https://colab.research.google.com), that works like Jupyter Notebook, but you need a google account and internet.

 To check what libraries are installed on Colab Google, execute

    !pip freeze

 To install new libraries exectute

    !pip install *****
